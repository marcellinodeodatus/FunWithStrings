-------------------- Fun With Strings ---------------------------
This program demonstrates the use of several Methods for Strings:
* char charAt(int i)
* int compareToIgnoreCase(String i)
* boolean contains(String s)
* int length()
* String replace(char c, char d)
* String toLowerCase()

The program first prompts the user to enter 2 Strings. Then it will present the user with a menu:
1) Print out which of the two strings comes first, alphabetically. (Or, if they are equal, print this out.)
    In making the comparison, ignore the case of the letters.
2) Print out whether the second String entered is a substring / is contained within the first String entered.
3) Print out the lowercase version of the second String entered.
4) Print out the number of times the first letter in the String appears in the String.
5) Print out the result when you replace all occurrences of 'e' in the second String with 'o'.
6) Quit
